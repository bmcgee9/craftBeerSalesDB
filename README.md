# craftBeerSalesDB
## Brett McGee

### Summary:
This summer, I created a craft beer relational database using public online data and hosted this DB with AWS RDS. I then made a front end website hosted on an AWS ec2 server. My front end allows users to search my DB and even includes a authentication system using PHP. Seperately, I queried my DB to answer some analysis questions about craft beer.

### Milestone 4:
Task 1 documentation: [main documentation](milestone4.md) & [show of functionality for enhancements](enhancement.md) <br>
Task 2 documentation: [answering questions](questionsAnswered.md) <br>
Task 3: I have compiled links to all of my information in this README file. 
### Milestone 2 & 3:
Please refer to the [build documentation](buildDocumentation/).
### Milestone 1:
Dataset of craft beers and their sales downloaded from Kaggle for class project.

- Find implementation details and proof of implementation in ./IMPLEMENTATION.md and ./ProofItIsWorking.md respectively.
- Look in [enhancement.md](enhancement.md) to see my frontend in use.
- Look at [milestone4.md](milestone4.md) and [milestone4Journal.md](milestone4Journal.md) to learn more about how I created this frontend, my timeline in doing so, and some of the issues that I encountered along the way.

4 Example Analysis Questions:
1) Which country has the beer in highest demand?
2) Which price point of beer sells the most (in Russian Ruples / liter)?
3) What was the most popular beer and vendor?
4) What were the most popular ABVs of the beers?

The real world applications of this data may help new beweries decide what products to brew.

Resources: </br>
- SimpliLearn tutorials (great video on creating a PHP login form) </br>
- W3Schools (a huge help in terms of learning what I can use with HTML and CSS)
- The class labs from module 7 were also a great resources
