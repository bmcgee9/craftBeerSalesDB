# craftBeerSalesDB
## Brett McGee
Dataset of craft beers and their sales downloaded from Kaggle for class project.

- Find implementation details and proof of implementation in ./IMPLEMENTATION.md and ./ProofItIsWorking.md respectively.
- Look in [enhancement.md](enhancement.md) to see my frontend in use.
- Look at [milestone4.md](milestone4.md) and [milestone4Journal.md](milestone4Journal.md) to learn more about how I created this frontend, my timeline in doing so, and some of the issues that I encountered along the way.
