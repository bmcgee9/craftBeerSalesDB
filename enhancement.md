# Enchancement - Creating a Frontend
## Brett McGee

For my enhancement, I created a complete frontend for my database that allows users to query in multiple ways. </br>
Here is a picture of the homepage `index.html`:</br>

</br>
On this page, there are two main features. One is the first search box where you can search for details on your favorite craft beer by its name (or just part of its name). In order to use this feature, you must type in the name of the craft beer like this: </br>

Then you press the submit button directly right of the search field and you will be taken to a table showing the details of the craft beer that you searched for. The results page is very easy to navigate with a standard scroll bar and a visually pleasing layout and color scheme. The row you hover on even becomes highlighted!</br>
