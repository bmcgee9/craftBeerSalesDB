# Database build plan: 
## Brett McGee

1) In excel, add an order_id column to the transactions table
2) Review all data in both tables to ensure they have consistent formating
3) Import both transactions and products tables using the "Table Data Import Wizard" tool you find after right clicking the schema
4) Ensure that product_code and order_id are primary keys in their respective tables
5) Add product_code as a foreign key to the transactions table
