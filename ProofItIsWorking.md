It includes a lot of screenshots of the standard DB and the bottom of this file shows me answering one of the questions I posed in Milestone 1 (Which country has the craft beer in highest demand?).

## Answering Which country has the craft beer in highest demand?
Based on the query and results shown in the screenshot below, the craft beers in highest demand are generally brewed in Russia. Russia sold a total of 101,518 craft beers which is way above the next highest country of Belgium at 13,051 craft beers sold.
